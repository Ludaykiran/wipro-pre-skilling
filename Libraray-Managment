Library Management System: Introduction to C# Object-Oriented Programming( Without Collection)
In this assignment, you will create a simple library management system using C#. You will define a custom class called Book to represent books and implement basic functionalities to add and view book records.

Task:

Define the Book Class:
Create a C# class named Book.
Add properties to the class: Title (string type), Author (string type), and Year (integer type).
Implement a constructor in the Book class to initialize these properties.
Input Handling:
Use the Console.ReadLine() method to prompt the user to enter the book's title, author, and year.
Convert the user input for year to an integer using Convert.ToInt32() method.
Create an Instance of the Book Class:
Instantiate the Book class using the input provided by the user for title, author, and year.
Print Output:
Print out the values of the Title, Author, and Year properties of the created Book instance to the console.


//code

using System;

class Book
{
    // Step 1: Define properties
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }
    public int Year { get; set; }

    // Step 2: Define constructor
    public Book(string title, string author, int year)
    {
        Title = title;
        Author = author;
        Year = year;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Step 3: Prompt the user to enter book's title
        Console.WriteLine("Enter book's title:");
        string title = Console.ReadLine();

        // Step 4: Prompt the user to enter book's author
        Console.WriteLine("Enter book's author:");
        string author = Console.ReadLine();

        // Step 5: Prompt the user to enter book's year
        Console.WriteLine("Enter book's year:");
        int year = Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());

        // Step 6: Create an instance of the Book class
        Book book = new Book(title, author, year);

        // Step 7: Print book details
       // Console.WriteLine("\nBook Details:");
        Console.WriteLine($"Book Title: {book.Title}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Book Author: {book.Author}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Book Year: {book.Year}");

        // Pause the console to allow the user to see the output
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
